The client pod's DNS configuration is correct, and the kube-dns service is operational. However, the frequent restarts of the coredns pods suggest instability in the DNS service, which could be causing intermittent DNS resolution issues. Further investigation into the coredns logs is needed to pinpoint the root cause.
