user_prompt: "Why is the web-frontend deployment not scaling up despite high CPU usage in namespace-118?"
tags:
  - kubernetes
expected_output:
  - HPA trying to scale web-frontend from 5 to 15 replicas but only 8 pods running
  - New pods stuck in Pending state because cluster reached maximum node count
  - Cluster autoscaler cannot add more nodes due to cloud provider limits or node pool maximum
  - Current nodes are fully utilized with no available CPU/memory for new pods
