user_prompt: "Why is the postgres-1 pod not starting in namespace-121?"
tags:
  - kubernetes
expected_output:
  - postgres-1 pod cannot start because its PVC is bound to node-a but pod is scheduled on node-b
  - PVC data-postgres-1 has nodeAffinity constraint to node-a from previous binding
  - Pod cannot access the volume because it's on a different node than the PVC
  - Need to either force pod to schedule on node-a or migrate the PVC
