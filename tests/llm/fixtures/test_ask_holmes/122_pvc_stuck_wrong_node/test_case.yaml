user_prompt: "Why is the data-processor deployment failing to start in namespace-122?"
tags:
  - kubernetes
expected_output:
  - data-processor pod cannot start because PVC is bound to a volume on node-c which is now cordoned/unavailable
  - PVC shared-data is stuck on node-c and cannot be rescheduled to available nodes
  - Pod keeps getting scheduled to node-a or node-b but cannot access the volume
  - Need to either uncordon node-c or migrate the PVC to an available node
