description: |
  A pod had database connection errors 6 days ago that were resolved, but now has a different
  error (memory issues) today. Holmes should focus on the recent error and not be distracted
  by the old resolved database errors.

user_prompt: "Why is the payment-processor pod failing?"

  - kubernetes

before_test: |
  kubectl create namespace app-124 || true
  kubectl apply -f ./deployment.yaml -n app-124
  # Create test pods that simulate the scenario
  kubectl run old-error-simulator -n app-124 --image=busybox --restart=Never -- sh -c "echo 'Simulating old resolved errors' && sleep 3600" || true
  kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app=payment-processor -n app-124 --timeout=60s || true

after_test: |
  kubectl delete namespace app-124 --force --grace-period=0 || true

expected_output:
    Holmes should identify the current memory/OOM issue and not get distracted by
    the old database connection errors that were resolved 6 days ago.
