user_prompt: "Why is the kafka cluster not forming properly in namespace-120?"
tags:
  - kubernetes
expected_output:
  - Kafka cluster not forming because StatefulSet pods restarted in wrong order
  - kafka-2 started before kafka-0 and kafka-1, breaking cluster formation
  - kafka-0 and kafka-1 pods are in CrashLoopBackOff waiting for leader election
  - StatefulSet should restart pods in order (0, 1, 2) but parallel pod management policy caused out-of-order startup
