  A web service is experiencing 503 errors but they're buried in thousands of successful
  requests. Holmes needs to filter by status code and identify the pattern - all 503s
  are happening on a specific endpoint during high load.

user_prompt: "Troubleshoot 503 errors in api-server app-131 namespace"

tags:
  - logs

before_test: |
  kubectl create namespace app-131 || true
  kubectl apply -f ./manifest.yaml -n app-131
  kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app=api-server -n app-131 --timeout=60s || true

after_test: |
  kubectl delete namespace app-131 --force --grace-period=0 || true

expected_output: |
  503 status codes occur on the /api/reports/generate endpoint when requests take longer than 30 seconds.
