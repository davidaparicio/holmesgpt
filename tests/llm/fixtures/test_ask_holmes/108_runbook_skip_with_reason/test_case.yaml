  The investigation should:

  2. Successfully execute basic checks (pod status, logs, memory metrics)
  3. Explicitly explain that heap dump analysis step is skipped
  4. Provide clear reason why: JVM tools (jmap) not available in Python container
  5. Complete other feasible investigation steps from the runbook
  6. Identify high memory usage and GC warnings from logs
