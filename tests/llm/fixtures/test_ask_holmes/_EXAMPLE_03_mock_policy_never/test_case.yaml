# This example demonstrates mock_policy: never_mock
#
# With this setting:
# - The test ALWAYS uses live tools, never mocks
# - Test is automatically skipped if RUN_LIVE is not set
# - Useful for integration tests that must verify real behavior
# - Cannot be used in CI without live cluster access
#
# Use cases:
# - Testing actual tool integrations
# - Verifying real API responses
# - Debugging tool implementations
