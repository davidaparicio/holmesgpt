# This example demonstrates mock_policy: always_mock
#
# With this setting:
# - The test ALWAYS uses mock data, even when RUN_LIVE=true
# - Useful for tests that must be deterministic
# - Ensures tests don't accidentally hit real APIs
# - If mock files don't exist and --generate-mocks is set, they'll be generated
#
# Other mock_policy options:
# - "never_mock": Forces live execution (skips test if RUN_LIVE not set)
# - "inherit": Uses global settings (default behavior)
